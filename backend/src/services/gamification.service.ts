/**
 * Transparent, predictable XP rewards by difficulty.
 *
 * A perfect 100% attempt gives EXACTLY this many XP. Anything below scales
 * down quadratically — so 50% gives 25%, 70% gives 49%, etc. That curve is
 * what makes high scores feel rewarding: the gap between a 70% and a 100%
 * is much bigger than between 30% and 60%, which is the gamification hook.
 *
 * Examples (Hard test, baseXp=100):
 *   100% accuracy  -> 100 XP (perfect)
 *    90% accuracy  ->  81 XP
 *    80% accuracy  ->  64 XP
 *    70% accuracy  ->  49 XP
 *    50% accuracy  ->  25 XP
 *    30% accuracy  ->   9 XP
 *     0% accuracy  ->   0 XP
 *
 * Olympiad caps at 150 so an absolute mastery run can yield 150 XP — your
 * "10/10 on SAT = +100" example sits at the Hard tier (Olympiad is rarer).
